Hey guys, here's the last video from our "Tal and Tali in China" series - this is "A Horse Busy Transporting Grain" (揚鞭催馬運糧忙), a bright and joyful Chinese song by Wei Xianzhong, performed with Tal Zilber.

The best part about traveling, many say, is living for a while as someone else in an alien culture, with different food, different habits, scenery, climate, sounds and signs. The tension between the completely unknown and the remotely familiar - that chicken soup that is almost like the one I used to eat at home - but with a totally new, undescribable twist, which I don't quite know where to place on my palate. The ability to be curious about everything - trying to give it a name, relate it to a memory, make sense of that contradictory feeling - that is, to me, the best thing about touring.

This piece threw me right into that alternate reality. To my western-music accustomed ears, it sounds like a transformed and reconstructed version of such familiar music phrases. It made me think of what the Sopranino Concerto in C would sound like if Vivaldi was born in China. And of course the answer is - nothing like this at all. I wish I could hear this music through someone else's ears.

I hope you enjoy this, and looking forward to touring and discovering again in 2022!
