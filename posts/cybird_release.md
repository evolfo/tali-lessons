This EP, full of passion and goofiness, is a story of two people who always wanted to be cool, but ended up playing a harpsichord (or a recorder, in my case). Two people who love music so much and so fully, they won’t let having only two hands stand in the way of playing two keyboard instruments at once (or, two recorders). Two people whose minds love experimenting, but whose hearts are stuck deep in the 17th century. It’s a story about wanting to break free and return home, all at the same time.

I’m so excited to share our creation, composed so thoughtfully and intricately by Apollonio Maiello. Cover art and animation by the person who does not cease to blow my mind, Scott Siskind. Recorded at ATLAS Tonstudio (GER), Mastering and Mixing: Jürgen Losigkeit. Management by the real wonder woman, Floriana Maddalena Maiello.
