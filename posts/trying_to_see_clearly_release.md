I'm uber (not sponsered by Uber) excited to share this news - my new song, "Trying to See Clearly", is now out on all platforms!! (see link to full song in the comments). 
I composed this song to the wonderful, fierce and merciless lyrics by Nachum Mochiach a while back, about a woman trying to find her way through the harshness of the big city and the lack of intimacy and connection, intensified by noisy and overwhelming city scenery.

I pieced the song together in collaboration with my dear friend and amazing talent, my musical soulmate, Yoni Marianer, who did the musical production. I'm truly grateful to be surrounded by inspiring people such as Yoni and Nachum, as well as the rest of the team:

Micha Gilad - keys
Yoni Marianer - vocals, guitar and bass
Noam Israeli - drums
Itamar Shatz on the mix
Mastered by JJ Golden Golden Mastering

If you listen carefully (and try to see clearly...), you'll hear my recorders coloring the track throughout the whole song behind my voice.
Thanks for following, listening and supporting!
Yours truly,

~ Tali
